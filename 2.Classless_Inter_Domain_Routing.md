# Classless Inter Domain Routing

Ip addresses are assigned by IANA(Internet Assigned Number Authority).

Classless IP addresses
-
- With Classfull Ip addresses Customization of no of hosts is not possible. If an enterprise needs 100 public ip addresses, it has to purchase a Class C network with 256 ip addresses.
- In Classless Ip address ranges are called blocks. So, a classless ipaddress contains BID(blokc id) and HID.
- A classless IP will have variable length BID and HID.
- To identify BID and HID part, Classless ip addresses use CIDR notation.
- CIDR notation reprentation contains no of bits of BID along with IP address. For ex: 20.10.1.2/20, where 20 bits are for block id and 12 bits are for HID. so, no of hosts in the block are 2^12.

Rules for forming CIDR blocks
-
- All the ipaddresses are contiguous.
- Block size restriction
  - Block size must be of 2 power n. So, block size must be 64,128,256 etc.
  - Any binary divided by 2^k, lease significant k bits represent remainder and the remaining most significant bits represnt quotient.  It is easy to choose BID and HID parts of the ipaddress if block size power of 2.
  - Let's take an example of 1011(Decimal 11) dividing by 2.

|Binary number	| Divider	    | Remainder		  |Quotient		   |
|---------------|:-------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
|1011	 	 	|2^1    		|1   		      |5(101)		   |
|1011  			|2^2    		|3(11)	   		  |2(10)		   |
|1011  			|2^3    		|3(101)	   		  |1(1)			   |
|1011  			|2^2    		|4(1011)   		  |0			   |

- First IP address should be evenly divisible by block size restriction
  - 
  - Consider the last octet of the first ip address in the block. If divided by block size, if remainder is 0, the no of bits in BID and HID part will be same.
  - If first remainder is not 0, then no of bits in BID and HID part will change. 
  - The below ipaddresses form a CIDR block with size 16. The BID bits are 4, HID bits are 28.

        10.1.2.32<br>
        10.1.2.33<br>
        ...<br>
        10.1.2.47
   - If ipaddress starts with 10.1.2.33, last ip address is in the block is 10.1.2.48. This will result in BID and HID part change in the last ip address.

Questions CIDR
---------------
1)Given the below list of ipaddresses, findout if they form a CIDR block?<br>
10.1.2.32<br>
10.1.2.33<br>
...<br>
10.1.2.47

Ans: 
1st rule is passed -> ipaddresses are contiguous.<br>
2nd rule is passed -> no of ipaddresses(16) should be 2 power n. <br>
3rd rule is passed -> First ipaddress should be divisible by block size(16).<br>

32 in binary is 00100000. If we divide this block size(16) i.e. 10000, we get remainder as 0000. Hence this is evenly divisible.

2)Given a Classless ipaddress(10.1.2.35/27, 10.1.2.35/20), findout the address range?<br>
Ans: Block size is 32-27=5. 35 in binary is 00100011. Replace the last 5 digits with 0's returns 00100000. i.e. 32. So, the address range is from 10.1.2.32 to 10.1.2.63.

For the second question, the block size is 32-20=12. So, the Ip address for last two octets in binary form is 10.1.00000010.00100000. Making the least significant 12 bits 0's gives the starting ip address of the block. This results in 10.1.0.0.

Subnets in CIDR
---------------
- Consider an ipaddress in CIDR range 10.1.2.10/25. HID contains 7 bits. This CIDR block contains 128(2^7) ipaddresses. 
- The ip 10.1.2.10 in binary form is 10.1.2.00001010. The starting ip for this block is 10.1.2.00000000. 
- Divide them into two subnets. 
  - First subnet range is 10.1.2.00000000 to 10.1.2.00111111. 
  - The second subnet range is 10.1.2.01000000 to 10.1.2.0111111. 
  - The Ipaddress for subnets are 10.1.2.0/26 to 10.1.2.63/26 and 10.1.2.64/26 to 10.1.2.127/26. 
  - The block id for the subnets are 10.1.2.0/26 and 10.1.2.64/26. No of bits in BID became 26. This extra 1 bit is used to identify the subnet.
 - Dividing the above into 4 subnets
   - 2 bits are needed to represent the subnet. No of bits in BID becomes 27.
   - The ipaddresses range in 4 subnets are 10.1.2.0/27 to 10.1.2.31/27, 10.1.2.32/27 to 10.1.2.63/27,10.1.2.64/27 to 10.1.2.95/27,10.1.2.96/27 to 10.1.2.127/27. 

Variable length subnet masking(VLSM)
-
- ISP providers like TATA/Airtel gets the ipaddresses from IANA and allocate to companies. To sell different ipaddress ranges for different companies VLSM is required.
- VLSM in CIDR happens the same way as in Classful ipaddresses. 
- For ex, 10.1.2.10/25 needs to be divided into 3 subnets, with one subnet containing 64 ipaddresses, second and third contains 32 ipaddresses each. 
- For the first subnet, 1 bit is sufficient to represent the subnet id. So, it's BID is 10.1.2.0/26 and range is 10.1.2.0 to 10.1.2.63.
- For the second subnet, two bits are required to represent the subnet id. So, it's BID is 10.1.2.64/27 and range is 10.1.2.64 to 10.1.2.95.
- For the third subnet, two bits are required to represent the subnet id. So, it's BID is 10.1.2.96/27 and range is 10.1.2.96 to 10.1.2.127.
