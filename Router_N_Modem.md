Router
------
- Router is a physical device that joins two or more networks like internet and a local network.
- Early routers provided several Ethernet ports for wired connections, most modern routers offer wireless connectivity also.
- Wireless routers often have one or two moveable antennas on the sides, though some models have them internal to the device.
- Wireless routers allow multiple computers and other devices(such as smartphone and tablets) to join the same network.
- Connecting to a router provides access to local area network(LAN). LAN does not necessarily provided access to internet.
- Router must be connected to a modem to get access to internet.
- Routers often have a specific Ethernet port that is designed to connect to the Ethernet port of a cable or DSLmodem.

Types of Routers
-

Broadband router
-
- With Voice over IP (VoIP) technology, a broadband router is needed to access internet over phone. These are often a special type of modem that will have both Ethernet and phone jacks.

Wireless Routers
-
- Wireless routers connect to modem and create a wireless signal in to home or office. 
- Computers within a range can connect to wireless router and use broadband internet. 
- To prevent unwanted access to your network, router needs to secured.
- 
Securing router
-
- Connect from any of the devices to WhatIsMyIPAddress.com to get the deviceIP address. 
- Login to the router through web browser(using the ipaddress) from the above system.
- Default user name and password that comes with router can be customized.

Modem(Modulator/Demodulator)
-
- A modem is a device that provides access to the Internet (see below).<br>
- Modem connects to ISP(internet service provider) either cable or DSL Internet service.
  - Cable modems have a coaxial (or "coax") connection.  These are same type of connector found on a TV or cable box. 
  - DSL(Digital Subscriber line) modems have a telephone connector, also called an RJ-11 jack, which connects to a telephone socket on the firewall.<br>
  - By connecting modem to the router (instead of directly to a computer), all devices connected to the router can access the modem, and therefore, the Internet.
  - Router provides a local IP address to each connected device, but they all get same external IP address provided by ISP.

Device connection order is outlined below:
-
PC or wireless device<br>
Router<br>
Modem<br>
ISP<br>
Internet

Note: While the router and modem are usually separate entities, in some cases, the modem and router may be combined into a single device. This type of hybrid device is sometimes offered by ISPs to simplify the setup process.
